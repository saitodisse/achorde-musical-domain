# Architecture

`achorde-musical-domain` is a public TypeScript contract package for musical software. It provides shared data shapes for parsers, renderers, editors, and applications that need to exchange chord-chart, tab, diagnostic, and fretted-voicing data.

## Included Scope

- parser diagnostic contracts
- parsed chord-symbol contracts
- textual tab AST contracts (`ParsedTab` — canonical chart AST with four strict line kinds)
- legacy chord-chart AST contracts with sections, lines, and segments (`ChordChartAst`, deprecated)
- fretted-instrument voicing contracts
- an explicit port for external music-theory adapters

## Excluded Scope

- React
- local storage
- sync
- routing
- product-specific application rules
- SVG rendering
- complete text parser implementations
- bundled music-theory engines

## Dependency Rule

Consumers should depend on this package for shared public contracts and keep implementation-specific behavior in their own packages. Parser libraries own parsing behavior. Renderer libraries own visual rendering. Applications own persistence, sync, routing, and product workflows.

## Versioning Rule

Contract changes follow semantic versioning:

- patch releases may clarify docs or fix non-breaking type details
- minor releases may add optional fields or new exported contracts
- major releases may rename, remove, or structurally change public contracts
